Description: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have recently acquired a boost of interest 
    for their implication in several biological conditions. 
    However, many of these elements are not yet annotate. 
    LErNet is focused on a new network analysis method for 
    annotating lncRNAs and guide the enrichment analysis. 
    The core is a network expansion algorithm that aims to 
    enrich the context of lncRNAs. The context is constructed 
    by integrating the genes encoding proteins that are found 
    next to the non-coding elements at both the genome and 
    the system level. The pipeline is particularly useful in 
    situations where the functions of discovered lncRNAs are 
    not yet known.
